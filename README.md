### Project Description
This interactive and playful web-based mini-game demonstrates DOM manipulation, animation, and event handling using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, a snail slowly moves across a track. Every time the user clicks (or "slaps") the snail, it speeds up slightly and the nearby tree grows taller. If the snail isn't fast enough, it falls into a pit placed strategically before the tree. Fun visual effects, sound cues, and dynamic messages enhance the user experience, making it both entertaining and educational.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
the snail lost it's life due to our lack of patience!!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Just stop slapping it again and again
